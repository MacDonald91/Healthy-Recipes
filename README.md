Healthy Recipe Website: A Journey into CSS Structure
Website Link: https://macdonald91.github.io/Healthy-Recipes/

Welcome to the repository for my "Quinoa and Kale Salad Recipe" website! This project was a focused exploration into how CSS is used to structure and style web content, bringing a clean and readable layout to a simple recipe page. It demonstrates fundamental CSS concepts and their application to create a visually organized user experience.

About the Project
This project centers around a static web page showcasing a healthy recipe. My primary goal with this build was to solidify my understanding of CSS structure, selectors, and how to apply styles efficiently to different elements across an HTML document. It's a foundational step in my journey to create well-organized and aesthetically pleasing interfaces.

Diving into CSS Structure
The core of this project lies in its style.css file, which is meticulously crafted to control the visual presentation of the index.html. Here's a breakdown of the key CSS structuring techniques and elements styled:

Element Selectors: Basic styling for HTML tags like img, h1, h2, p, and li to set default appearances such as image size and font families.

Class Selectors: Used to apply styles to multiple elements that share a common characteristic, like .description for the recipe summary and .time for individual preparation step timings.

ID Selectors: Utilized for unique elements that need specific styling, such as #cook-time for the total preparation time.

Descendant Selectors: Demonstrated with .ingredients li to style list items specifically within the ingredients unordered list, and .citation .external-link to target the link inside the citation paragraph. This shows how to apply styles to elements based on their position within the HTML hierarchy.

Universal Selector (*): Employed at the beginning to implement a CSS reset, ensuring consistent styling across different web browsers by removing default margins and paddings, and setting box-sizing for easier layout management.

Font Styling: Custom font families (like Helvetica) are applied to various text elements for a cohesive look.

Color and Visual Cues: Colors are used strategically, for instance, gray for time indicators and SeaGreen for the external recipe link, to enhance readability and user guidance.

This project emphasizes the power of a well-organized stylesheet to manage and control the visual presentation of web content effectively.
